# Snake-Game

This is my python game I hope you like it, but first I'll explain the commands and how to get the Code to work

The commands to play are the keyboard darts, 

do not click any buttons other than the 4 darts, or the game will stop automatically!!!

in the code I said that when the snake collides with itself it dies so if you click up and down at the same time the snake will die because the head will collide on the other parts (The same happens with right and left)

to get Snake.py to work you have to install some things from cmd or powershell ... First open a powershell and type "python -m pip install windows-curses" so that your device widows (this code is only for windows) to be precise your cmd from where we will start the game understand the commands ..
P.S. you must have python installed on your PC. 

if you don't want to install windows-curses by hand I created Curses install.bat, just run it and it will do everything by itself

if you lose ... there is no need to restart snake.bat, because when you lose it takes you back to the cmd and I wrote the command "python snake.py" at the top ... just copy and send it in the cmd and you are back in the game ...

To open the game, all you have to do is open the snake.bat file, 

Good Game!!!!
