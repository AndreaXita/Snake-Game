# Snake-Game

This is my python game I hope you like it, but first I'll explain the commands and how to get the Code to work

The commands to play are the keyboard darts

to get Snake.py to work you have to install some things from cmd or powershell ... First open a powershell and type "python -m pip install windows-curses" so that your device widows (this code is only for windows) to be precise your cmd from where we will start the game understand the commands ..
P.S. you must have python installed on your PC

To open the game, all you have to do is open the snake.bat file

Good Game!!!!
